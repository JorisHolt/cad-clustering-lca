# CAD Clustering using Latent Class Analysis

This repository provides all derivation, functions, and validation steps for assigning cardiovascular patient clusters using a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) model derived from the SWEDEHEART registry.

## Structure

- `derivation/`: Cluster derivation in the SWEDEHEART dataset, including model selection and interpretation.
- `functions/`: Fully hardcoded and documented cluster assignment function using pre-specified LCA probabilities.
- `validation/`: Evaluation of function performance on external data (SMART) compared with `poLCA.posterior`.
- `figures/`: Visuals used across HTML outputs (e.g., elbow plot, correlation heatmaps).
- `docs/`: HTML-rendered reports for web access via GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages

> No individual-level data are shared. All results and figures are fully reproducible from the included scripts and functions.
